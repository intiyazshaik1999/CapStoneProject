Handwritten Digit Recognition:
The goal of a handwritten digit recognition system is to take an input image of a handwritten digit and accurately classify it into one of the ten possible classes (0 through 9). This is a fundamental problem in computer vision and pattern recognition.
The MNIST dataset is a collection of 28x28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten digits (0 through 9). It consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images. Each image is labeled with the corresponding digit it represents.
In this project I will be working especially on the MNIST dataset pre-processing for the project.Depending on the scale of the dataset, I will focus on optimizing the preprocessing pipeline for speed and efficiency, especially if the project requires handling large volumes of data. By guiding the MNIST dataset preprocessing, I want to give the project with a firm basis for training the CNN model. This will improve my data analytical skills.
